The generally accepted explanation for the “extra” radiogenic Sr in modern island arcs is the addition of radiogenic, seawater-derived Sr to the subarc mantle by way of the subducting, seawater-altered slab. Because this exchange between the hydrosphere and Earth’s interior is critical for understanding global element cycling and continental crust growth, we wanted to know whether slab-related enrichment is a long-lived feature of island arc geochemistry.</p> <p>We compiled Sr isotope data from island arc magmatic rocks of all ages, and filtered for unaltered, crustally uncontaminated samples. The temporal variation in island arc Sr isotopes shows some intriguing similarities to (1) the Sr isotopic evolution of seawater through time and (2) the record of Sr concentration in seawater through time. We interpret this apparent arc-seawater connectivity as evidence that the transfer of Sr from ocean, to seafloor, to mantle, to island arc magmas has been ongoing since the Paleoproterozoic. If this interpretation is correct, it implies that hydrothermal alteration and subduction have operated on very long timescales.</p> <p>The paper can be read here - <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2401832121" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Temporal covariation of island arc Sr isotopes and seawater chemistry over the past 2 billion years</a>.

With enough data spanning enough Earth history, the ophiolite record can be used to probe longterm temporal variations in hydrothermal alteration regimes and altering fluid chemistry at spreading centers like today’s mid-ocean ridges.</p> <p>It’s been noted that some Cretaceous and Ordovician ophiolites exhibit larger shifts towards seawater Sr isotope values as compared to modern altered oceanic crust, perhaps indicating more vigorous seawater-seafloor isotopic exchange during these periods of the Phanerozoic. This has been attributed to different seawater chemistry and/or warmer ocean temperatures compared to today. Compared to the Phanerozoic, much less is known about Precambrian seawater chemistry and hydrothermal alteration. Motivated by the idea that geochemical patterns through ophiolite profiles can elucidate some aspects of these dynamics, we are measuring Sr isotopes through the basalt, sheeted dike, and gabbro sections of two Paleoproterozoic ophiolites.</p> <p>These Paleoproterozoic ophiolites also serve as potential tool to answer the longstanding questions surrounding the oxygen isotopic composition of the Precambrian ocean. Analyses of Proterozoic sedimentary rocks consistently yield negative oxygen isotope values. If these are primary signatures, it suggests either that surface temperatures were significantly warmer or that oceans were depleted in <sup>18</sup>O on the Proterozoic Earth. Either of these possibilities have significant implications for how we conceptualize climate, weathering, and mass and heat exchange in the Precambrian. In contrast, O isotopes from the igneous rock record suggest seawater has maintained its zero permille δ<sup>18</sup>O signature on long timescales, presumably buffered by hydrothermal alteration at spreading centers. Robust datasets of O isotopes through profiles of very old ophiolites might help resolve this discrepancy, but such datasets are currently sparse. To fill this gap, we are measuring O isotopes through the basalt, sheeted dike, and gabbro sections of two Paleoproterozoic ophiolites.</p> <p>I’ve gained experience in field sampling and planning, sample processing, XRF and (LA-)ICPMS prep chemistry and analysis, and qualitative and quantitative petrography at Caltech. At UC Berkeley/LBNL I have worked for several months on acid digestion and column chromatography chemistry (Sr and Nd) in a clean lab, TIMS, and MC-ICPMS. Upcoming work will involve analysis with thermohydrochemical modeling tools and redox titration.</p> </div> <hr> <div class="profile float-right"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/summarygraphicDM.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="summarygraphicDM.jpg" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="more-info"></div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p><strong><em>The Sr isotopic evolution of the depleted mantle (revisited)</em></strong></p> <p>Both the research topics described above involve interpreting deviations in measured Sr isotopic compositions with respect to the depleted mantle. Implicit in this is the idea that there exists a “baseline” depleted mantle isotopic composition with which to compare the e.g. island arc or ophiolite data.</p> <p>But unlike for the Nd isotope system (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703798002749?casa_token=FTZNyGrb12IAAAAA:3l8NXcIt0r-7zghDPk1JZBwSnklceDZjnAySZ7hVJE2EJnVCVN1BvYX_3vDlOoKKsbTD5PiWseVc" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vervoort &amp; Blichert-Toft, 1999</a>), there is no “evolution curve” for depleted mantle <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr that is based on the rock record. Attempts to build such a curve were undertaken several decades ago, but all the compiled <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr data (mostly from island arc magmatic rocks) were too high - elevated compared to what you’d expect for Sr isotopes in mantle-derived rocks, given they should correlate with <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd. The consensus was that the Rb-Sr system is too easily disturbed for Proterozoic mantle-derived rocks to preserve primary <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr signatures. Lacking a rock-based Sr isotope depleted mantle evolution curve, people have modeled mantle <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr through time, using reasonable assumptions about depletion events and continental growth in the Archean coupled with the Rb/Sr of Earth’s silicate reservoirs and the well-constrained <sup>87</sup>Rb-<sup>87</sup>Sr decay constant.</p> <p>The resulting curves are extremely useful, but it is interesting to consider whether the rock record is consistent with what has been modeled. Post-eruptive weathering and alteration in very ancient rocks is certainly a complication, but in light of our recent finding that island arc rocks have exhibited elevated <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr for the last two billion years, it is also probably inherently problematic to use island arc rocks for the purpose of building a mantle evolution curve, even if they are technically derived from the depleted mantle. This is inconvenient, since the preservation potential of subduction-related magmatic rocks is a lot higher than it is for MORB!</p> <p>I am attempting to constrain depleted mantle <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr evolution by compiling gabbros and peridotite from ophiolites, which are our best analogs of unaltered MORB. I am searching for samples that are (1) purely upper mantle-derived (minimal subduction influence) and (2) preserve their primary values. Subsequent comparison to modeled isotope evolution curves should provoke some thought about longterm isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle and depletion dynamics.</p> </div> <hr> <div class="profile float-left"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/pastresearchgraphic.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="pastresearchgraphic.jpg" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="more-info"></div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p><strong><em>Past projects</em></strong></p> <p><em>Carbon in the mantle - undergraduate thesis (2019):</em> My senior thesis at the University of Rhode Island was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U1dR9LAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Katie Kelley</a> and is titled <em>New constraints on mantle carbon content from variations in CO<sub>2</sub>/Ba ratios in undegassed mid-ocean ridge basalt</em>. I wafered undegassed olivine-hosted melt inclusions from the Easter Microplate and we analyzed them with FTIR and EPMA. That these OHMIs are carbon-undersaturated and thus undegassed is rare, and they presented an opportunity to directly measure CO<sub>2</sub> and evaluate whether the proxies commonly used to estimate primary CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in degassed samples are robust and universal. Specifically, the CO<sub>2</sub>/Ba ratio is assumed to be constant in MORB, so people often use barium concentrations to calculate CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, which are then extrapolated to constrain global mantle carbon. This CO<sub>2</sub>/Ba constancy assumption had only been verified by a few sample suites, though, so our aim here was to add a robust dataset from a new location to the existing literature.

Advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6laH_QsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Woody Fischer</a> and motivated by the observation that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/352516a0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">gases from volcanic fumaroles contain polyphosphate</a>, I carried out some calculations to assess whether volcanic polyphosphate production on the modern Earth is substantial enough to warrant serious consideration that early Earth volcanoes were a significant source of bioavailable phosphate for the early biosphere. This work involved thermodynamic modeling, a data compilation, and field sampling at active fumaroles in Yellowstone National Park.</p> <p><em>Quantifying the pace of an extinction event preserved in Petrified Forest National Park (2017):</em> The ca. 215 Ma Adamanian-Revueltian faunal turnover is remarkably preserved in Petrified Forest National Park (Arizona, USA).
