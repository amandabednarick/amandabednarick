I am a fifth-year graduate student advised by [Claire Bucholz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D6awU0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) working on problems related to igneous petrology. My thesis chapters center on the geochemistry of ophiolites and island arcs, the longterm isotopic evolution of the mantle, and the history of subseafloor hydrothermal alteration. My work involves field, lab, and computational components - see the "Research" page for project details. I am based in Pasadena, CA and I'll finish a PhD in geochemistry in June 2026. 

We recently published a compilation of Sr isotope data from island arc magmatic rocks spanning two billion years of Earth history, and the result suggests that surface seawater chemistry has influenced the igneous rock record since at least the Paleoproterozoic!
