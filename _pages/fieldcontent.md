Working and teaching at Caltech and living in southern California has afforded me the opportunity to see a wide range of geological settings. My recent experience in the field includes:

- Presenting at and attending the 2025 GSA Thompson Field Forum to study ophiolite and arc assemblages preserved in western and central Cuba (2025)
- "Enrichment" field trip to Mongolia with geologists from Caltech and the Mongolian University of Science and Technology (2025)
- Assistant teaching Ge 121 (Advanced Field Geology) to map and measure the geochemistry of tuff deposits preserved in a Miocene basin in the Mojave (2025)
- Assistant teaching Ge 121 (Advanced Field Geology) to identify ignimbrites and understand the eruptive history of the eastern Mojave (2024)
- Assistant teaching Ge 120 (Introduction to Field Geology) to equip undergraduate students with mapping skills needed for summer field camp (2023)
- Earning a 4-wheel driving certification in Jawbone Canyon (2023)
- Assistant teaching Ge 122 (Field Geology seminar) to discuss the morphology and geochemistry of young monogenetic volcanoes in the Mojave (2022)
- Planning and leading a two-week sampling excursion of the Payson ophiolite to study ancient hydrothermal alteration and seawater chemistry (2022)
- Planning and running local field trips for Pasadena students as part of our department's [outreach organization](https://go-outdoors.caltech.edu/) (2021-2023)
- Assisting Calvin Rusley (Caltech) with stream sampling for novel phototrophs (2022)
- Sampling volcanic gases emitted from various Yellowstone fumaroles with USGS scientists as part of a project to consider quantities of Earth's abiotically produced polyphosphate (2021)
- Assisting Juliet Ryan-Davis (now at MIT) with sampling of [mafic plutons in the Sierran foothills](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/17353/) (2021)
- Attending 15+ department-run weekend geotourism field trips around the southwestern US (2021-2025)


Prior to graduate school, I was fortunate to attend Iowa State's Geology Field Camp in the Bighorn Basin, WY (2019) thanks to URI's Roger Larson memorial scholarship. In 2017 I was Riley Hayes's (now at UC Berkeley) research assistant for a 12-week field season during which we (re)identified fossil localities and measured section in Petrified Forest National Park to quantify the pace of an extinction event preserved there. You can read the resulting publication in *Geology* [here](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/48/4/318/579957/Modeling-the-dynamics-of-a-Late-Triassic?searchresult=1). I also got to take field courses to study geomorphology in New Zealand (2020), sedimentology in Utah and Arizona (2019), hydrology in Indonesia (2017), geomorphology and climate in New Hampshire's White Mountains (2016), and various geological sites around Rhode Island, where I grew up.
